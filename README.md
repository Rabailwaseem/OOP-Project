Project Title
Snake Game in C++ Console (OOP)

Project Statement
Develop a classic snake game using Object-Oriented Programming principles in C++, playable within a console environment.

Features List
⦁	Snake Movement: Continuous movement of the snake in four directions (up, down, left, right).
⦁	Food Generation: Random generation of food items on the console grid.
⦁	Score Tracking: Display of current score based on the number of food items eaten.
⦁	Game Over Conditions: End of game when the snake collides with itself or the console boundaries.
⦁	User Input: Real-time user input for controlling the snake's direction.
⦁	Dynamic Snake Length: Increase in snake length with each food item consumed.
Possible Solution
Implement the game using classes to represent key components like the snake, food, and game board. Use a game loop to manage the real-time aspects of the game, such as movement and collision detection. Handle user input asynchronously to ensure smooth gameplay. Use basic console output functions to render the game state and update the display as the game progresses.

Source of Idea
The idea for this project comes from a classic and well-known list of programming project ideas.
